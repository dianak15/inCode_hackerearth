This file contains assets, such as avatar, maps; index.html and manifest.json. The file manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the homescreen on Android.
The file index.html runs on Javascript. The %PUBLIC_URL% has been used in the tags in the index.html file. It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build. Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML. Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
